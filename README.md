# Call Centre Performance Dashboard ‚Äì October 2024

#### Purpose
- The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive, interactive dashboard for monitoring and analyzing inbound customer support calls across multiple channels-call center, chatbot, email, web.
- This dashboard is designed for customer support managers, business analysts, and operations teams to:
     Track call volumes and response performance
     Identify trends in customer sentiment and reasons for contact
     Optimize resource allocation and improve service levels

#### Problem Statement
Large call centers receive thousands of inbound queries daily through various channels. Without real-time tracking and insights, it's challenging to understand customer needs, measure agent performance, and optimize service levels.

This dashboard solves that problem by aggregating call data, sentiment analysis, and performance metrics into a single view.
